## deploying machine learning web app using heroku and streamlit

This app contains forms for 3 machine learning models that predict "Diabetes" , "Parkinsons" , "Heart Disease" 

![user interface of my app](https://github.com/MouadEttali/streamlitHerokuApp/blob/main/HerokuStreamlitapp.PNG  "Streamlit Heroku Machine Learning app ")


This app uses binary classifiers such as Logistic regression and SVM to give an accurate prediction of these 3 types of diseases

## performances:

- Diabetes data : 89% recall,  91% precision
- Parkinsons data : 85% recall,  89% precision
- Heart Disease data : 91% recall,  96% precision
